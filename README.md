# Tree Visualizer üå≥

Welcome to the **Tree Visualizer**! This full-stack project enables users to visualize and interact with various types of trees dynamically. With a real-time backend powered by PostgreSQL and Supabase, the application integrates GitHub webhooks to track live commits and repository statistics. It also features an intuitive Konva.js canvas for rendering tree visualizations based on user input.

## üéØ Features

- **Dynamic Tree Generation**: Generate trees interactively from user-provided arrays, including Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and more.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Stay updated with live commit tracking and repository statistics through GitHub webhooks integrated with Supabase.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore trees visually on a canvas powered by Konva.js, with features like zooming, panning, and node highlights.
- **Extensibility**: Additional tree types and features are under development to further enhance visualization capabilities.

## üîß Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js** (Framework for React and server-side rendering)
- **React** (Frontend library)
- **TypeScript** (Static typing for better code quality)
- **Konva.js** (Canvas rendering for interactive visualizations)

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** (Handles all API calls directly within the framework)
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL-based real-time backend)

### Integrations
- **GitHub Webhooks** (Live commit tracking)

### Deployment
- **Vercel** (For deploying the full Next.js application, including API routes)

cd tree-visualizer
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using Yarn
yarn install
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the following:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Supabase
    1. Log in to Supabase and create a new project.
    2. Set up a PostgreSQL database.
    3. Add tables for commits and other required entities.
    4. Retrieve the API URL and anon/public key from the project settings.
### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Enable GitHub Webhooks (Optional)
    1. Navigate to your GitHub repository settings.
    2. Go to Webhooks and click Add webhook.
    3. Set the payload URL to your deployed backend endpoint (e.g., https://<your-vercel-app>/api/webhook).
    4. Add the secret from your .env.local file.
### üìà Future Features
- Visualization for additional tree types, such as:
    - B-Trees
    - Splay Trees
- Enhanced analytics for commits, including:
    - Top Contributors
    - Commit Heatmaps
- Exporting tree visualizations as PNG or JSON.
- Animating the *insertion* and *deletion* operation
